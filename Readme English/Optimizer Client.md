### Mod Compatibility

FS Optimizer **comes bundled** with the following mods:

* **Embeddium Dynamic Lights**
* **Oculus**

These mods usually work fine, **but may conflict with some external mods added to your modpack**.

> ❗ If you experience **crashes on startup or during gameplay**, it is **strongly recommended to try removing *Embeddium Dynamic Lights* and *Oculus*** from the optimization modpack.
> These two mods are **not essential for performance** and can be safely removed if compatibility issues arise.
